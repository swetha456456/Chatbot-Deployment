NLP Problem statement:

we have different types of documents in the repository called as 
share parts.
overhere, last 1 year of documents we need to classify the files
into groups to perform automatic content and product document
classification.

Gen AI:

To design and develop intelligent chatbot capable of generating 
creative content for various applications including marketing
customer engagemnt, and personalized communication.the chatbot 
should leverage advanced models and AI techniques to produce
high quality, contexually relevantand engaging content
automatically.

Self-Introduction:

Hello, my name is swetha, and I am a Data Scientist with 2.7 years of experience in the field. 
My expertise lies in Generative AI,  Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
Over the years, I have worked on various AI models and deployed them to solve practical business problems, utilising a range 
of advanced algorithms and technologies.

In Generative AI, I have hands-on experience with models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and diffusion models, 
focusing on generating creative content such as text, images, and video. I've worked on building chatbots, content generation tools,
and other AI-powered solutions customised for specific business needs.

For Machine Learning, I am proficient in using algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Means Clustering, and 
Support Vector Machines (SVM). I have developed models for predictive analytics, fraud detection, and customer segmentation, 
employing techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and feature engineering to optimise model performance.

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), I have worked on projects like sentiment analysis, text classification, named entity 
recognition (NER), and language translation. I have utilised models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from 
Transformers) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) to solve a wide range of text-based problems, including chatbot development 
and text summarisation.

Additionally, I am experienced in using tools like GitHub for version control and Jira for project management and team collaboration.
I believe in writing clean, efficient code and following best practices in code quality and version management.

As a team player, I enjoy working in collaborative environments and sharing knowledge with peers to achieve common goals. 
I have mentored junior team members, contributed to code debugging, and consistently strive to improve code quality in projects.

I am always keen to learn and apply the latest advancements in AI to deliver impactful solutions. My goal is to leverage data-driven 
insights and AI to make a positive difference in business outcomes.
