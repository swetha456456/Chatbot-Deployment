Self Introduction:
------------------
Myself Siva Kumar, having 3.10 years experience in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision 
on both Telecommunication and Banking domains.
I have worked on end to end data science machine learning projects starting from data collection, preprocessing, model building, 
model validation and model deployment. 
My experience includes applying both supervised and unsupervised algorithms to solve complex data science problems.
I have strong expertise in Python, particularly with frameworks like Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, and Keras. 
Good Exposure in generating visualization graphs by using Seaborn, Matplotlib.
I have strong knowledge on oracle database, where i used SQL language to fetch data from the database.
I am an actually individual contributor i have also been part of multiple teams.
I use github, ServiceNow and jira for project management, i am familiar with these tools.   
Last 2 years, i have working on Gen AI Chatbot projects 
And prior to this i have worked on Signature Verification and Forgery Detection project to upskilling my self while doing 
this in Computer Vision.
Before to this i have worked on Churn predictions.
My Day to Day responsibilities are primarily coding in python, solving Data science machine learning projects.

4 years of experience in Data Science and Machine learning with skill sets that help in building supervised and 
unsupervised machine learning models, data modelling using Python (Pandas, Numpy).

Project -1: TaxBot
## Problem Statement: 
Businesses and individuals  are facing challenges in accurately calculating taxes based on varying tax laws, 
deductions, and income brackets. Manual tax calculation is time-consuming, prone to errors, 
and can result in missed deductions or incorrect filings. 
To address this issue, we developed a tax-bot capable of automating tax calculations by extracting relevant data 
from documents (PDFs, CSVs) and applying tax rules to deliver accurate tax computations.

## Tax-bot assists users in:
Determining tax liabilities based on income, expenses, and applicable deductions.
Parsing and extracting data from financial documents.
Providing detailed reports for tax filing purposes.
Offering support for tax-related queries and compliance with local tax regulations.
